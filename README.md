# AI Certification Exam Generator

This repository contains a prototype for automating the creation of practice certification exams using a multi-agent AI pipeline.

The high-level plan and milestones are tracked in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). The first implementation focuses on the **Terraform Associate (003)** exam but the framework will be reusable for other certifications.
